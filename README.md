# [Identifying key factors influencing cancellations](https://github.com/GayathriArunDass/Hotel-Booking-and-Cancellation-Prediction.git)

I did this project as part of my PostGraduate Program, where I have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations and build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

- Computed basic statistical measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
- Visualized data distributions using histograms, box plots.
- Discovered trends using line plot.
- Algorithms used : Logistic regression and Decision tree
